# Device info
All devices have a hard-coded firmware flash webpage at: http://\<deviceip\>/iweb.html

This webpage allows to configure the device wifi parameters and flash new firmware.
No matter which firmware you flash, this webpage is always there (make the device almost "unbrickable").

There is another webpage at: http://\<deviceip\>/

In here you can setup the wifi parameters, change the access user/pass and flash new firmware too.
The access to there webpages is password protected.
The user/pass defaults to admin/admin.
If you upgrade to the latest official firmware, the user/pass is changed to admin/Lumlink@100

# TODO
* Add dayly/weekly timers (configurable by webpage)
* ... and suggestions are welcome (open an issue)
